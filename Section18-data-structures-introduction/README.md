# Section 18: Data Structures Introduction

Welcome to the Data Structures Introduction section of the **JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Masterclass**. In this section, Colt Steele provides an overview of data structures, explores the ES2015 class syntax, and demonstrates how to create and manipulate data structures using the class keyword.

## 104. Which Data Structure Is The Best?

In this video, Colt Steele discusses the considerations and factors that determine the choice of the best data structure for specific scenarios. Understand the strengths and use cases of different data structures to make informed decisions in your coding journey.

## 105. ES2015 Class Syntax Overview

Get acquainted with the ES2015 class syntax. Colt provides an overview of the class syntax, a fundamental feature introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6), which simplifies the creation and management of objects and data structures.

## 106. Data Structures: The Class Keyword

Explore the usage of the class keyword for creating data structures. Colt demonstrates how to define classes and instantiate objects, laying the foundation for building various data structures in JavaScript.

## 107. Data Structures: Adding Instance Methods

Dive into adding instance methods to your data structures. Colt guides you through the process of enhancing the functionality of your classes by incorporating methods that can be called on instances of the class.

## 108. Data Structures: Adding Class Methods

Extend your understanding by adding class methods to your data structures. Colt demonstrates how to create methods that are associated with the class itself, providing additional capabilities and flexibility in data structure design.

Feel free to explore each video at your own pace, experimenting with class syntax and creating your own data structures. Colt's explanations and demonstrations will empower you to leverage the class keyword effectively in your JavaScript projects. Happy coding!
