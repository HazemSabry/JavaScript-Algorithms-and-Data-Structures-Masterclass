# Section 29: Dynamic Programming

Welcome to the Dynamic Programming section of the **JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Masterclass**. In this section, Colt Steele introduces you to the concept of Dynamic Programming, a powerful technique for solving problems by breaking them down into smaller overlapping subproblems.

## 240. Intro to Dynamic Programming

Get introduced to the concept of Dynamic Programming. Colt provides an overview of how Dynamic Programming can be used to optimize solutions for various problems.

## 241. Overlapping Subproblems

Explore the importance of identifying overlapping subproblems in the context of Dynamic Programming. Colt discusses how recognizing these patterns can lead to more efficient solutions.

## 242. Optimal Substructure

Understand the concept of optimal substructure and its role in Dynamic Programming. Colt explains how breaking down a problem into optimal substructures contributes to solving larger problems.

## 243. Writing A Recursive Solution

Dive into writing a recursive solution for a given problem. Colt guides you through the process of developing a recursive approach and demonstrates the fundamental principles of dynamic programming.

## 244. Time Complexity of Our Solution

Understand the time complexity implications of the recursive solution developed. Colt discusses the efficiency of the initial recursive approach and highlights potential challenges.

## 245. The Problem With Our Solution

Identify the limitations of the recursive solution and potential pitfalls. Colt discusses common issues that arise with recursive approaches and sets the stage for optimization.

## 246. Enter Memoization!

Introduce the concept of memoization as a solution to the limitations of recursion. Colt demonstrates how memoization can be used to store and reuse previously calculated results.

## 247. Time Complexity of Memoized Solution

Explore the impact of memoization on time complexity. Colt discusses how memoization can significantly improve the efficiency of dynamic programming solutions.

## 248. Tabulation: A Bottom-Up Approach

Introduce tabulation as an alternative bottom-up approach to dynamic programming. Colt walks you through the process of solving problems using tabulation and discusses its advantages.

Feel free to explore each video at your own pace, experimenting with Dynamic Programming concepts. Colt's explanations and demonstrations will deepen your understanding of this powerful technique for optimizing solutions to complex problems. Happy coding!
