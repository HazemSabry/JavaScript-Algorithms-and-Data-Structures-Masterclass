# Section 6: 100% OPTIONAL Challenges

Welcome to the 100% OPTIONAL Challenges section of the **JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Masterclass**. This section presents additional coding challenges that are entirely optional but provide valuable opportunities to practice and reinforce your problem-solving skills.

## 36. IMPORTANT NOTE!

Before diving into the optional challenges, Colt shares an important note. Understand the nature of these challenges and decide whether you'd like to take them on for an extra layer of practice.

### Coding Exercise 3: Frequency Counter - sameFrequency

Challenge yourself with a frequency counter exercise, where you'll be tasked with determining if two positive integers have the same frequency of digits.

### Coding Exercise 4: Frequency Counter / Multiple Pointers - areThereDuplicates

Explore a challenge that combines concepts from the Frequency Counter and Multiple Pointers patterns. Determine if there are any duplicates among the provided arguments.

## 37. SOLUTIONS PART 1

Colt provides solutions to the first set of optional challenges, offering insights into effective problem-solving approaches.

### Coding Exercise 5: Multiple Pointers - averagePair

Apply the Multiple Pointers pattern to find if there is a pair of values in a sorted array whose average equals a specified target.

### Coding Exercise 6: Multiple Pointers - isSubsequence

Tackle a challenge involving the Multiple Pointers pattern, where you'll determine if a given string is a subsequence of another string.

## 38. SOLUTIONS PART 2

Continue exploring solutions to optional challenges with Colt's guidance.

### Coding Exercise 7: Sliding Window - maxSubarraySum

Utilize the Sliding Window pattern to find the maximum sum of a subarray with a specified length.

### Coding Exercise 8: Sliding Window - minSubArrayLen

Solve a sliding window challenge to find the minimum length of a contiguous subarray with a sum greater than or equal to a specified target.

### Coding Exercise 9: Sliding Window - findLongestSubstring

Explore the Sliding Window pattern further by finding the length of the longest substring with distinct characters.

## 39. SOLUTIONS PART 3

Colt concludes the optional challenges section by providing solutions and further insights.

Feel free to explore these optional challenges based on your comfort level and interest. Colt's solutions and explanations will guide you through the problem-solving process, offering valuable learning experiences.
