# JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Masterclass

Hello fellow coders! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my GitHub repository for the **JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Masterclass**. This incredible course, developed by **Colt Steele**, a seasoned Developer and Bootcamp Instructor, has been an absolute game-changer for me in my coding journey.

## My Experience

As a student, I found this 22-hour video series to be a condensed treasure trove of computer science and interview preparation. Colt Steele's teaching style, derived from in-person coding bootcamps, where students land 6-figure developer jobs, resonated with me. The content is the real deal - no watering down for an online audience.

## What I've Gained

Throughout this course, I've gained:

- **Confidence in approaching and acing difficult coding interviews.**
- **Mastery of popular algorithms, including 6 sorting algorithms.**
- **Hands-on experience implementing 10+ data structures from scratch.**
- **Improved problem-solving skills, making me a stronger developer.**
- **In-depth knowledge of advanced topics like Heaps, Graphs, and Dijkstraâ€™s Shortest Path Algorithm.**

## Course Overview

- **Interactive Learning:** Colt provides a chance to try every problem before revealing the solution.
