# Section 7: Recursion

Welcome to the Recursion section of the **JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Masterclass**. In this section, Colt Steele introduces the powerful concept of recursion, guiding you through its principles and application in solving problems.

## 40. PREREQUISITES

Before delving into recursion, ensure you have a solid understanding of the prerequisites outlined by Colt. These foundational concepts will prepare you for a deep exploration of recursion.

## 41. Story Time: Martin & The Dragon

Embark on a storytelling journey with Martin and the Dragon. Colt sets the stage by narrating a story that illustrates the essence of recursion, laying the foundation for the subsequent lessons.

## 42. Why Use Recursion?

Discover the advantages and scenarios where recursion shines. Colt provides insights into why recursion is a powerful tool in a developer's problem-solving toolkit.

## 43. The Call Stack

Understand the mechanics behind recursion by exploring the call stack. Colt explains how the call stack operates, providing clarity on how recursive functions are executed.

## 44. Our First Recursive Function

Dive into practical implementation with your first recursive function. Colt walks you through the process of creating a recursive function, laying the groundwork for your understanding of this powerful technique.

## Quiz 6: Recursion Quiz

Test your knowledge with the recursion quiz. Challenge yourself to apply your understanding of recursion principles and reinforce your learning through practical scenarios.

## 45. Our Second Recursive Function

Continue building your recursion skills with a second recursive function. Colt introduces additional concepts and challenges, helping you solidify your understanding of recursive patterns.

## 46. Writing Factorial Iteratively

Explore an iterative approach to writing the factorial function. Colt demonstrates how the same problem can be solved using an iterative method, offering valuable insights for comparison.

## 47. Writing Factorial Recursively

Compare the recursive and iterative approaches to writing the factorial function. Colt walks you through the process of writing factorial recursively, showcasing the elegance of recursive solutions.

## 48. Common Recursion Pitfalls

Avoid common pitfalls in recursion. Colt highlights potential challenges and mistakes that developers may encounter when working with recursive functions, helping you write more robust code.

## 49. Helper Method Recursion

Expand your understanding of recursion with helper method recursion. Colt introduces this technique, showcasing how it can be applied to solve specific types of problems.

## 50. Pure Recursion

Discover the beauty of pure recursion. Colt explains the concept of pure recursion and guides you through solving problems without the need for helper methods.
